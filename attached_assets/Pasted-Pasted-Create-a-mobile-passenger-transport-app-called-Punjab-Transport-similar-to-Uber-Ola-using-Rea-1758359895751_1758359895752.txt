Create a mobile passenger transport app called "Punjab Transport" (similar to Uber/Ola) using **React + Vite + TailwindCSS**.  
The app should be functional, not just UI. Use React Router for navigation and React state for interactions.  

🎨 Design System
- Colors: Primary Blue (#1976D2), White (#FFFFFF), Punjab Saffron (#FF6B35), Punjab Green (#059669), Gray (#F5F5F5).
- Dark Mode: Background (#121212), Text (#FFFFFF).
- Font: Inter, bold headings, clean body.
- Uber-style map-first layout with clean cards.

📱 Core Screens (Phase 1)
1. **Onboarding**
   - Placeholder for logo (empty box).
   - Tagline: “Smart Travel • Made Easy”.
   - 3 feature cards (Real-time Tracking, Smart Notifications, Journey Planning).
   - CTA: “Get Started” → navigate to Login.

2. **Authentication**
   - Login: Phone input (+91 prefix), "Send OTP".
   - OTP: 6 input boxes with countdown + "Verify & Continue".
   - Mock validation: any 6 digits accepted → navigate to Home.

3. **Home (Dashboard)**
   - Full map placeholder (use Leaflet.js or Google Maps API).
   - Floating search bar: “Where to?”.
   - Quick action buttons: “Find Routes”, “Book Ride”.
   - Nearby Stops list: show 3 dummy stops with distance + ETA.

4. **Routes**
   - Filter chips: All | Popular | Religious | Highway.
   - Route cards (dummy data): route number, From → To, ETA, status.
   - Each card has “Track”, “Favorite”, “Share”.
   - Clicking “Track” → opens Route Details.

5. **Profile**
   - Profile photo placeholder + name + phone.
   - Menu items:
     - Edit Profile
     - Trip History
     - Favorite Routes
     - Notifications
     - Language
     - Dark Mode (toggle theme)
     - Help & Support
     - Logout
   - All buttons must navigate or trigger a toast/modal.

📌 Interactivity Rules
- Use **React Router** for screen navigation.
- Use **useState** for theme, favorites, and language.
- Use **toast notifications** for all actions (e.g. “Route saved”, “Profile updated”).
- Add smooth scrolling for Home, Routes, Profile.
- Show error if phone/OTP inputs are empty.
- Dark Mode toggle applies immediately.

⚡ Extras
- Minimalist Uber-like black/white design with Punjab accents.
- Responsive layout for mobile-first.
- Include loading skeletons and button press animations.
- Don’t just describe—generate complete working React + Tailwind code with all screens, navigation, and state handling.
